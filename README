Installation
------------

Instructions on how to build and install shntool are contained in the INSTALL
file.  Be sure to read it, especially if you have any problems, as it will
contain important notes related to building and installing.  However, for most
people this process will be as simple as:

% ./configure
% make                           (or gmake, if make gives you trouble)
% su -c "make install"           (or install-strip, where strip is supported)


Documentation
-------------

A mostly-complete description of shntool's modes and command-line arguments are
contained in the man page.  A short tutorial can be found in doc/TUTORIAL.

To see what changes were made since previous releases, consult the ChangeLog
file.
